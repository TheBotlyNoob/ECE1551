== 5.3 SR Type Latch

=== NOR

SR type latches with both inputs as ZERO, make no change.

#highlight[Bistable device] is a circuit that is stable with both high and low as output---both are possibel.
with both inputs as ONE, both outputs are zero. this is makes an invalid state.

Acts as memory, because it can store the number/bits.

=== NA
